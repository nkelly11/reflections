When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  	When you would like to collaborate on a project or be able to access your project 
  	from other machines.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	This prevents un-needed commits form being made.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are basically cloned repos that link to other people's project only on GitHub.
	Clones are repos that are copied either locally or from GitHub.
	Branches are commits that deviate from master, but point to a master commit.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Having the last known state of the remote stored locally is beneficial becuase it allows
	you to determine when you want to merge if you are out of sync.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Email and file transfers? I really like the idea of GitHub so I think most things would be harder.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	Separate branches allow for collaboration and changing without affecting the master
	product/branch.
