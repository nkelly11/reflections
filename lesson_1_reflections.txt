How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Using diff removed the need to search through every line of code to
    find changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By enabling the ability to use diff to find all changes made between
    different versions of code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: It reduces the number of saved files. Mistakes aren't saved.
    Cons: If you forget to comit something, it is lost.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To more easily track changes in related files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will let you know which commits were made. 
    git diff will let you know what changed between each commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    By giving you the ability to return to a working copy that was
    previously saved.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Version control of apps I create.
